          <h3>Development</h3>
          <p>
            I've been learning how to code since 2010 when I first learnt
            Python, and continued to learn other languages like Java and C++
            throughout my university years, before graduating in 2014 with a
            Bachelor of Information Technology at Weltec.<br />
            <br />
            From there I got a job at CCPL Global starting in 2015 as a Junior
            Software Developer, where I was thrown into the deep end of
            Front-end Web development. This led me to pick up Web design and
            development courses in order to further improve my skills.

          <h3>Guitar</h3>
          <p>
            My favourite hobby is playing guitar, which I have been playing
            since 2003. I originally began learning to play on a nylon-stringed
            acoustic guitar with my friends in primary school, before switching
            to electric and ultimately steel-stringed acoustic.<br />
            <br />
            I have previously played as a part of my home church's music team,
            playing both lead electric guitar and rhythm acoustic guitar.
